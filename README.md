# IR Remote Transmitter and Receiver with Arduino
IR or infrared communication is one of the most common methods of wireless communication due to being easy to use and having an affordable price. Infrared light, with a wavelength longer than visible light, is not within the range of human vision. That’s why it’s a good option for wireless communications. When you press a button on your TV control, an LED on your control turns on and off continuously and causes a modulated infrared signal to send from the control to your TV.
